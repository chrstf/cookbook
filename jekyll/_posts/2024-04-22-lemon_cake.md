# Recipe Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 175 °C. Grease and flour a loaf pan. Add butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt to a bowl and beat with a hand mixer until fluffy (~ 5 min).
2. Beat in eggs one at a time. Add lemon zest, 110 mL lemon juice, and Greek yogurt and mix to combine. Mix flour and baking powder in a separate bowl, then add to butter-egg mixture and stir to a smooth batter.
3. Transfer batter into the prepared loaf pan, smooth out the top, and bake at 175 °C for approx. 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let cool down in the pan for approx. 15 min. before removing it from the loaf pan. Let cool completely on a wire rack.
4. Add confectioner’s sugar and remaining (ca. 40 mL) lemon juice to a bowl and mix into a thick frosting. Spread the frosting on the cooled lemon cake.
