1¼ TS (or 10 g)    | baking soda
¾ TS (or 6 g)      | salt
80 g               | brown sugar
15 g               | honey
90 g               | yogurt (or mascarpone, or sour cream, Bio-Kokos)
50 g               | unsalted butter, room temperature
2                  | eggs
450–500 g (or 3–4) | very ripe bananas
1                  | additional banana

# Recipe Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 180 °C. Lightly coat 25 cm loaf pan with vegetable oil and line with parchment paper, leaving a generous overhang on long sides
2. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl
3. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat brown sugar, yogurt, honey, and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes
4. Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend after each addition and scraping down sides and bottom of bowl as needed
5. Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture, and mix until just combined
6. Add bananas and mix just until combined
7. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth top
8. Cut additional banana in half along its long axis. Lay the two halves on top of the batter with the cut side facing up. Push banana halves into the batter until the cut surface is aligned with the batter surface
9. Bake bread until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 60–65 minutes
10. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let bread cool in pan 1 hour. Turn out bread and let cool completely (if you can resist) before slicing.
