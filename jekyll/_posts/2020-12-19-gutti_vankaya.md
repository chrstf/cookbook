# Recipe Preparation

1. Roast peanuts.
2. Roast Coriander seeds, Cardamom and 1 Handful Cumin seeds.
3. Make powder by grinding Salt, Chili powder and roasted ingredients from step 1 and 2.
4. Wash and cut brinjals in a cross-like manner. Keep stalk.
5. Stuff powder firmly into brinjals.
6. Fry Mustard seeds, 1 Handful of Cumin seeds in a generous amount of oil (quite a lot, ingredients are sucking up the oil).
7. Add Onions, Garlic, Ginger, Curry leaves and tumeric.
8. Lay in stuffed brinjals and fry them a bit.
9. Add Tomatoes.
10. After 1 minute add water (Lilli said, less water than oil).
11. Add Salt and Kashmiri Chili to taste.
12. Add Tamarind paste.
13. Let simmer until brinjals are done.
14. Cook rice or Chapathi in parallel.

# Notes

On a general note, usually when using Tomatoes we do not use Tamarind paste. When adding both, just reduce the amount of Tamarind paste.
